# Cyberbullying-Detection-Using-Multimodal-Analysis

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting cyberbullying in social media posts, particularly on Twitter. By analyzing the text content of tweets, the model classifies them as either positive or negative sentiment, with a focus on identifying negative sentiment indicative of cyberbullying. The project includes data preprocessing, model training using various algorithms, exploratory data analysis, model evaluation, and the development of a user-friendly web application for real-time prediction.
